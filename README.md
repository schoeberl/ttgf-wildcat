# Tiny Tapeout Wildcat

[Wildcat](https://github.com/schoeberl/wildcat) is an educational RISC-V core.
This tapeout contains the bare minimum: an assembler coded *blinking* LED
(In fact it counts up and displays the value on the 7-segment display).
No memory, no caches, no SPI based Flash (what was originally planned).
